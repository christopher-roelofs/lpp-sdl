# Console/Headless Mode Samples

This directory contains sample scripts that demonstrate LPP-SDL's headless mode functionality. These scripts run completely without a GUI window, making them perfect for:

- **Server environments** - Run on headless servers without display
- **Automation scripts** - Integrate into automated workflows
- **Command-line tools** - Create CLI utilities with Lua
- **Data processing** - Process files and data without graphics
- **Testing environments** - Run tests in CI/CD pipelines

## How to Run Console Mode

Use either the `-headless` or `-console` flag:

```bash
# Run a specific script
./lpp_sdl -headless samples/sdl/Console/index.lua
./lpp_sdl -console samples/sdl/Console/index.lua

# Launch interactive console REPL (no script specified)
./lpp_sdl -headless
./lpp_sdl -console
```

## Interactive Console REPL

When no Lua file is specified in console mode, an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is launched, providing a command-line interface for exploring and running scripts:

```bash
$ ./lpp_sdl -headless

=== LPP-SDL Console REPL ===
Type 'help' for available commands.

lpp-sdl> help
Available commands:
  help                 - Show this help message
  list, ls, dir        - List files and directories in current directory
  cd <directory>       - Change to directory (use .. for parent)
  run, load <file.lua> - Run a Lua script
  cat <file>           - Display file contents
  pwd                  - Show current directory
  info                 - Show system information
  clear                - Clear the screen
  lua <code>           - Execute Lua code directly
  exit                 - Exit the REPL
  quit                 - Exit the REPL

Examples:
  run samples/sdl/Console/index.lua
  cat samples/sdl/Console/README.md
  cd samples/sdl/Console
  dir
  info
  clear
  lua print('Hello from Lua!')
  lua local name = System.input('Name: '); print('Hi ' .. name)
  lua for i=1,3 do print('Line ' .. i) end

lpp-sdl> cd samples/sdl/Console
Changed to directory: ./samples/sdl/Console

lpp-sdl> list

### REPL Features
- **File navigation**: `cd`, `pwd`, `list` (aliases: `ls`, `dir`) commands for exploring directories
- **File viewing**: `cat <file>` command to display file contents with line numbers
- **Script execution**: `run` (alias: `load`) command to execute Lua scripts from any location
- **Direct Lua execution**: `lua <code>` command to execute Lua code directly in the REPL
- **System information**: `info` command shows platform details and available features
- **Screen management**: `clear` command to clear the console screen
- **Command aliases**: Familiar shell aliases (`ls`/`dir` for `list`, `load` for `run`)
- **Help system**: Built-in `help` command with examples and command reference
- **Tab completion**: Commands and paths with readline support
- **Command history**: Persistent history with up/down arrow navigation

## Error Handling

Console mode includes proper error handling:
- Graceful SDL cleanup without graphics
- File operation error checking
- Resource management
- Exit status codes

## Performance Benefits

Running in console mode provides:
- **Faster startup** - No graphics initialization
- **Lower memory usage** - No graphics buffers
- **Better resource efficiency** - No GPU usage
- **Server compatibility** - No display requirements

## Tips for Console Scripts

1. **Always call `System.exit()`** to ensure clean shutdown
2. **Check file operations** for errors and handle gracefully
3. **Use descriptive output** since there's no visual feedback
4. **Validate inputs** early in the script
5. **Clean up temporary files** before exiting

## Getting Started

1. Copy one of the sample scripts as a template
2. Modify for your specific use case
3. Test with the `-headless` flag
4. Deploy to your automation environment

These samples demonstrate the power of LPP-SDL for server-side scripting and automation tasks, showing how Lua can be used for serious system administration and data processing work without requiring a GUI.
