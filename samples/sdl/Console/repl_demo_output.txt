This file was created by a Lua script executed through
the LPP-SDL Console REPL. This demonstrates how you can:

1. Navigate directories with 'cd' and 'list'
2. Run scripts with 'run <filename>'
3. Use full Lua scripting capabilities
4. Access file system operations
5. Process data without any GUI

The console REPL makes LPP-SDL perfect for:
- Server automation
- Script development and testing
- File processing workflows
- Command-line utilities
- Educational purposes

Try these REPL commands after this script finishes:
  pwd
  list
  cd ..
  list
  cd samples/sdl/Console
  run data_converter.lua
